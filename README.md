My coursework for Operating Systems:

## Assignments:
- Assignment 1: Creating Linux Environment & C Programming Fundamentals
- Assignment 2: Memory Management & Synchronization Primitives

## Projects:
- Project 1: Multi-threaded Banking System Simulator
	- Build project1 from CLI:
		- BASH 
		- git clone https://github.com/Oddwyer/CS3502_W03.git
		- cd CS3502_W03/project1
		- rm phase1 (optional for clean build)
		- gcc -Wall -pthread phase1.c -o phase1
		- ./phase1 
	- Recommend running multiple times to see different results.
